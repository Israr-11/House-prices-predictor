# House Prices Prediction Model

This project contains code for training a machine learning model to predict house prices using the California housing dataset. The model is a Linear Regression model implemented using Python's Scikit-learn library.

## Project Structure

- `model_training.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the model.

## Model Details

The model is a Linear Regression model trained on the California housing dataset. It predicts house prices based on features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, and others.

### Dataset

The dataset used for training is the California housing dataset, which includes the following features:

1. MedInc: Median income in block group
2. HouseAge: Median house age in block group
3. AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household
4. AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household
5. Population: Block group population
6. AveOccup: Average number of household members
7. Latitude: Block group latitude
8. Longitude: Block group longitude

## Model Performance

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 0.5558915986952444
- **R2 Score**: 0.5757877060324508
